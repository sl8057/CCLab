                        The campanulas are the one and only creature living on the Moon. Campanulas don’t need sunlight or water to grow, thus they are susceptible to bright lights except moonlight. Thus, the butterflies evolved to flicker intermittently. Its scent is good for soothing anxiety, thus it’s used to treat mental disorders.
