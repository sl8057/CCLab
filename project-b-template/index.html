        <h2 >1. What Tigers Represent in Korean Culture</h2>
        <p>Tigers have been deeply intertwined with Korean culture and history, and it’s challenging to discuss one without mentioning the other. These majestic creatures are not only prevalent in various forms of art and idioms but also feature prominently in folk tales and historical texts. Traditionally seen as guardian animals, tigers are believed to have protected Korea since ancient times. Unfortunately, they are now classified as an endangered species within the country. The legacy of tigers and the spiritual values they embody should be passed down to future generations, much like how stories have traditionally been conveyed orally from one generation to the next. Even if tigers were to become extinct in the future, the rich tales and spirits they have inspired must not be allowed to fade into oblivion.</p>

        <h2><a href="page2.html" class="design">2. Folk Tales</a></h2>
        <p>Folk tales reveal the tiger as an ambivalent creature in Korean culture, symbolizing both fear and ignorance. Tigers were a significant threat, akin to natural disasters, leading to numerous fatalities. This fear was so prevalent that there even existed a specific profession dedicated to combating tigers. Ironically, despite their ferocity and danger, tigers are often depicted as naive or foolish in these stories. The tales frequently feature clever protagonists who outwit the tigers, using their wit to triumph. This narrative device is believed to reflect social dynamics, where the common people—often from lower social strata—use their intelligence to overcome challenges posed by the more powerful upper classes, metaphorically represented by the ignorant tigers. This portrayal serves as a subtle critique of social hierarchies, illustrating the resourcefulness and resilience of the common folk.</p>

        <h2><a href="page.html" class="design">3. Strange Story</a></h2>
        <p>Myths and old folk tales are vital components of cultural heritage, and they often carry unique, sometimes eerie narratives. There is a particularly haunting tale related to the frequent tiger attacks in some regions. According to this tale, those killed by tigers are believed to turn into ghosts that are bound to follow the very tigers that killed them. These spirits, trapped in servitude, are said to lead other humans to the tigers in hopes of being released from their bondage. This belief has significant social implications; families often hesitate to marry individuals who have lost relatives to tiger attacks, fearing the curse associated with these ghostly spirits. To counteract this curse, specific rituals are performed. The remains of those killed and partially eaten by tigers are cremated. Additionally, the area where the attack occurred is often marked and enclosed with a tower of stones to contain and eradicate the spirits.</p>
